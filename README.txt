CRETIN is a 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional non-LTE atomic kinetics / radiation transfer code. It self-consistently
follows the time evolution of atomic populations and photon distributions as radiation interacts with a low-density
plasma. In this folder i have created a 'cretin frontend' to ease the use of the sofware and implement the functionality of 
python into the so called generator files. In this folder you'll find the cretin manual, some data files, some .py files which create the functionality of the tool and the cretin_main file where i showcase the functionality.

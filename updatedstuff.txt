\section{Introduction}
In order to sustain Moore's Law in the semiconductor industry, Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) has become a key technology in the mass manufacture of today's most sophisticated integrated circuits (ICs)\cite{Bakshi2018EUVLithography}. In the pursuit of cleaner and more efficient sources of EUV radiation, laser-produced plasma (LPP) has been investigated as a potential method. Tin (Sn) plasmas have received special attention because of their ability to create EUV light at the critical wavelength of 13.5 nm \cite{Fomenkov2017AdvOptTechnol}. The strong reflectivity of the molybdenum/silicon multi-layer reflectors in this "in-band" region makes this wavelength range ideal.

The most effective way to manufacture this radiation is to focus high-intensity CO2 laser light onto pre-shaped tin micro droplet targets, resulting in a laser-produced plasma (LPP). The plasma contains large populations of Sn11+ - Sn15+ ions which generate intense, narrow band EUV radiation through bound-bound atomic transitions. However, the study of short-wavelength laser-driven plasma's for nano-lithography has sparked significant interest, especially in the context of debris generation, which may limit the lifetime of optical components. The laser wavelength sets the critical electron density, determining the densities for which EUV radiation is generated and must propagate through. Efficiency at different laser wavelengths is therefore determined by a trade-off in numerous underlying physical processes. 

In the realm of inertial confinement fusion and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the irradiation of condensed-matter targets by relatively long laser pulses in the ablation regime is a common practice. An ablation front, in simpler terms, is a key feature in the study of materials interacting with intense laser beams, such as in laser ablation processes. When a laser beam hits a material, it can generate a plasma, if the velocity by which the plasma expands because of the heating overcomes the forces holding the droplet together, the material is ablated and leaves the system. An ablation front is the boundary between the material that is and isn't being ablated. 

Under these circumstances, the structure of quasi-stationary ablation fronts—that is, ablation fronts whose structure evolves slowly over time becomes critical. Historically, the structure of these fronts has been investigated under a number of simplifying assumptions, with thermal conduction of electrons and laser light absorption being the main activities. Nonetheless, thermal radiation's potential for energy transmission has largely gone unnoticed. 

The study of these double ablation fronts is not only crucial for understanding the stability of the EUVL process but also for optimising the efficiency of EUV generation. An important field of study is the complex interplay among the physical processes at the ablation fronts, the plasma properties, and the EUV emission spectrum that results. To achieve high conversion efficiency in EUVL, this spectrum—dominated by unresolved transition arrays (UTAs) in highly charged Sn ions—is essential.

In this study, we investigate the details of radiation transport-induced double ablation fronts in densely laser-produced tin plasma's. Our goal is to understand the intricate relationships that control the stability and effectiveness of EUV formation in these plasma's. Through the use of theoretical models based on work by J.sanz [1-4] and simulations using the Cretin software package supplied by the Lawrence Livermore national laboratory.


\section{Theory of ablation fronts}
In this paper we describe a 1d analytical model of double ablation fronts in a differential phase context. A simplification of the radiation hydrodynamic theory comes from the assumption of a discontinuous transition between the optically thick and the thin regimes, with a characteristic transition Temperature $T_{t}$ at which the transition occurs. The optically thick regime follows a 

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{The temperature T and density $\rho$ as a function of the distance both normalised with respect to their value at the radiative ablation front. The first ablation front is at $y = 0$. The characteristic transition temperature is reached around  $y/L_{s,t} = 140$. On the left hand side of the transition the medium is optically thick, on the right hand side the medium is optically thin}
    \label{fig_2}
\end{figure}
We will use the steady isobaric model of Kull which makes use of the isobaric approximation. It assumes subsonic ablation at approximately constant pressure. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
P = P_{a},
\quad\text{}\quad 
\rho \nu  = \rho_{a} \nu_{a}
\quad\text{and}\quad 
\rho T = \rho_{a}T_{a}.
\end{equation}
The density $\rho$ and the temperature $T$ are functions of the spatial coordinate y and the index $a$ implies a value at the ablation front. Using these equations we introduce an auxiliary variable $\theta$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
\theta = \frac{T}{T_{a}} = \frac{\nu}{\nu_{a}} = \frac{\rho_{a}}{\rho}.
\end{equation}
The ablation front is steady, meaning that all functions are assumed to be constant in time. The first ablation front is at y = 0 and the electronic ablation front occurs between the optically thick and optically thin regimes. Note that in 1d momentum conservation does not need to be imposed since it follows from the isobaric approximation. The energy conservation equation can be written as follows.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
    \frac{d}{dy} \big(\frac{5}{2}P_{0} \nu - \kappa_{s}(T)\frac{dT}{dy}\big) = -\frac{dS_{r}}{dy},
\end{equation}
where $\frac{5}{2}P_{0}\nu$, $\kappa_{s}(T)\frac{dT}{dy}$ and $\frac{dS_{r}}{dy}$ respectively represent the convective, electronic and radiative heat transfer. $\kappa_{s}$ is the Spitzer thermal conductivity which we normalise with respect to $T_{a}$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
    \kappa_{s}  = \kappa_{s,a}\big(\frac{T}{T_{a}}\big)^{5/2}.
\end{equation}
In our model the derivative of the radiative flux $S_{r}$ is discontinuous at the boundary between the optically thin and optically thick regimes. The optically thick radiative flux equation is derived in the footnote on the radiative transfer equation and the optically thin radiative flux equation behaves like a black body.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
\frac{dS_{r}}{dy}=\begin{cases}
			 -\frac{d}{dy}\big( \kappa_{r}(T)\frac{dT}{dy}\big), & T < T_{t}\\
            4 \sigma K_{P} \big(T^{4} - T_{r}^{4}  \big), &  T  \geq T_{t},
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation} where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
$\kappa_{r}$ is the Rosseland thermal conductivity, and $K_{p}$ is the Planck mean volume opacity. In this analysis the radiative temperature $T_r$ is assumed constant. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
\kappa_{r} = \kappa_{r,a} T^{q_{1}+3}
  \quad\text{and}\quad 
  K_{P} = K_{P,a}\Bigl(\frac{T}{T_{a}}\Bigl)^{\frac{-11}{2}}.
\end{equation}
$q_1$ is a material constant that usually lies in the range $1<q_1<4$. An exact formula for the Planck mean volume opacity can be found in \cite{ZeldovichRaizer1966} where it is a function of the density, however due to the isobaric assumption, equation \ref{eq:6} is valid. For simplicity we assign each type of heat transfer its own parameter. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
\begin{split}
a  \equiv \frac{5}{2}P_{a}\nu_{a},
   \quad\quad 
b  \equiv \kappa_{s,a}T_{a},
   \quad\quad 
c \equiv \sigma T_{a}^{4},
   \quad\quad 
   \\
L_{a}  \equiv \frac{b}{a},
   \quad\quad 
Bo_{a}  \equiv \frac{a}{c},
   \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
 where a,b and c are the coupling for the convective, electronic and radiative heating respectively, $L$ is the characteristic length for electronic thermal diffusion and $Bo$ is the Boltzmann number, a dimensionless parameter measuring the relative importance of convective and radiative heat transfer. Using equation \ref{eq:2} we can make the energy conservation equations \ref{eq:3} and \ref{eq:5} into a one dimensional (only depending on the variable $\theta$) second order differential equation.
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
\frac{d}{dy} \big(a\theta -b\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{dy}\big)=\begin{cases}
			-\frac{d}{dy}\big(\kappa_{r,a}T_{a}(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{dy}\big), & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
           c K_{P,a} \big(\theta^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a,
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_r = T_r/T_a$ and is assumed constant across the spatial domain. Multiplying both sides of equation \ref{eq:9} with $\frac{b}{a^2}$ and taking the derivative with respect to the new parameter $\eta = y/L_{a}$ such that $\frac{d f(y)}{dy} = \frac{1}{L_{a}}\frac{d f(y)}{d\eta}$. The result is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:9}
\frac{d}{d\eta}\big( \theta -\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big) =\begin{cases}
			-\frac{d}{d\eta} \big( \kappa_{r,a} T_{a}/b(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big), & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
           \beta_{a} \big(\theta^{4} -  \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{a} \equiv \frac{bc}{a^2 K_{P,a}}$. This shape of the equations is particularly nice since in the domain $\theta \geq T_t/T_a$ the only constant left over is  $\beta_{a}$. It should be noted that $\kappa_{r,a}T_a/b= \kappa_{r,a}/\kappa_{s,a} $, this ratio is a material constant that for most materials is roughly equal to 10. In the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ we can remove the differential operators on both sides and solve for $\frac{d \theta}{d \eta}$, 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:10}
\begin{split}
    \frac{d \theta}{d \eta} = \big(\theta^{3/2} + c \theta^{q_1+2}\big)^{-1} \text{,  where  } c = \frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}T_a^{q_1+3}\\
    \Longrightarrow\Big[\frac{2}{5}\theta^{5/2}+\frac{c \theta^{q_1+3}}{q_1+3} \Big]_{\theta_0}^{\theta} = \eta. \quad\quad\quad\quad
\end{split}
\end{equation}
If we apply the same transformations that were applied to equation \ref{eq:9} to the radiative flux from equation \ref{eq:3} the result is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:11}
    \frac{d}{d\eta}\big( \theta -\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big) = \frac{d}{d\eta}\frac{-S_r}{a} \equiv - \frac{d\phi}{d\eta}.
\end{equation}
Where we have defined $\phi$ and in doing so have essentially split our second-order differential equation of the variable $\theta$ into two coupled first-order differential equations of the variables $\theta$ and $\phi$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:12}
\begin{split}
\theta -\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}  =-\phi \Longrightarrow \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = \frac{\theta + \phi}{\theta^{(5/2)}}
\\
\frac{d \phi}{d\eta} =\begin{cases}
			  -\frac{d}{d\eta}\big(\frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big), & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
             \beta_{a} \big(\theta^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.
		 \end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Hamiltonian flow}
Note the variables left over in equation 12: $\frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}$, $ q_1$ and $T_t$ are all material constants that assuming we intend to use tin as the source in our EUV laser, we would be unable to change. Leftover are $T_a$, $T_r$ and $\beta_a$. These are the only 3 parameters (excluding the initial values of a trajectory) that we could use to change the trajectory defined by our differential equations. Viewing the differential equations from the perspective of equations \ref{eq:12} allows us to create a stream plot of $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ and $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$, where we simultaneously show the values of $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$, $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ and the trajectories that follow as a consequence of every initial value. To do this additional care must be taken in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ since in a stream plot there can be no derivatives on the right hand side. We insert the expression for $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:12}, calculate the derivative, solve for $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$, insert  $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ again and show the result for completeness.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:13}
    \frac{d \phi}{d\eta} =\begin{cases}
			 -\frac{T_a^3 (\theta +\phi ) (3 \theta +2 \theta q_1 + 2 q_1 \phi +\phi ) \left(\theta  T_a\right){}^{q_1}}{2 \theta ^3 \left(\sqrt{\theta } T_a^3 \left(\theta  T_a\right){}^{q_1}+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}\right)}, & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
             \beta_{a} \big(\theta^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
For completeness and later reference we will also write down the 2nd order differential equation as a function of $\theta $ and $ \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:14}
        \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2}=\begin{cases} -\frac{\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} \left(5\frac{\kappa_s}{\kappa_r} \theta^{3/2} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta}-2\frac{\kappa_s}{\kappa_r}+2   ( q_1+3) T_a^3 \theta^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} (T_a \theta)^{ q_1}\right)}{2\frac{\kappa_s}{\kappa_r} \theta^{5/2}+2 T_a^3 \theta^3 (T_a \theta)^{ q_1}}
        & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
        \frac{-2 \beta_t \theta_R^4+2 \beta_t \theta^4+2 \theta^{11/2}\frac{d \theta}{d \eta}-5 \theta^7\frac{d \theta}{d \eta}^2}{2 \theta^8} 
        &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.\\
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\caption{The stream plot of $\theta$ and $\phi$ consists of trajectories resulting from the vector plot in Figure \ref{fig:vectorplot}. For each starting condition $\theta(0), \phi(0)$ the resulting trajectory is shown. The vectors are superimposed only on the trajectories. The red line is the parameterization of $\theta$ and $\phi$ from figure \ref{fig_2} We have used the same values as in figure \ref{fig:vectorplot}}
\label{fig:streamplot}
\end{figure}
In figures \ref{fig:vectorplot} and \ref{fig:streamplot} we've set $T_a$ = $T_t$, this implies that the electronic ablation front is located at $\theta = 1$. This marks the clear division between the left-hand side and the right hand-side in these figures. For the same reason the point where $\theta$ and $1/\theta$ cross in figure \ref{fig:streamplot} is the electronic ablation front. Setting both derivatives equal to 0 in equation 13 returns $\theta = -\phi$ as a solution for $\theta < T_t/T_a$. This intuitively comes from $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ having $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ as a divisor for $\theta < T_t/T_a$ in equation 12. This implies that any trajectories that have initial values that fulfil $\theta_0 > -\phi_0$  for $\theta < T_t/T_a$ will never end up on the other side of the line $\theta = -\phi$ (intuitively if there is a region where the velocity of an object is zero, the trajectory of that object could never cross that region, see figure \ref{fig:streamplot}). 

\section{Limiting behaviour}
Looking at the non-material parameters from equation \ref{eq:13}, $T_a$, $T_r$ and $\beta_a$, in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$, only $T_a$ has an effect which is why in this subsection we will consider the following limits of the model looking at it from either the angle of the second order differential equation \ref{eq:10} or the 2 coupled first order differential equations \ref{eq:12}. We will consider the following limits 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{The cases are N/A when the limit we are taking is not inside the domain of the function we are considering. NiF refers to when the variable we are taking the limit of is not inside the function we are considering. The values in the table represent the exponent of the power law scaling of the solutions $\theta(\eta)$ (to leading order) of the differential equations in that particular limit.}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|X|X|X|}
    \hline
   $\theta <T_t/T_a $ & $\theta$ & $\phi$ & $T_A$ \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to 0}$ & 0  & 2/5  & $2/5$  \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to \infty}$ & NA  & 2/7  &  $1/(4+q_1)$ \\
    \hline
    \hline
    $\theta \geq T_t/T_a $ & $\theta$ & $\phi$ & $T_A$ \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to 0}$ &  NA & 2/5  & NiF  \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to \infty}$ & 2/5  & 4/7  & NiF  \\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}
Starting out with the limits of $T_A$ we rewrite equation \ref{eq:13} for the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ in the following way 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:15}
        \frac{d \phi}{d\eta} =
			 -\frac{(\theta +\phi ) (3 \theta +2 \theta q_1 + 2 q_1 \phi +\phi )\theta^{q_1}}{2 \theta ^3 \left(\theta^{(q_1+1/2)}+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}T_a^{-(3+q_1)}\right)}.
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:14} suggest that the limit $\lim_{{T_a \to 0}} \frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}} = 0$ since $q_1 > -3$. What that means in the context of figure \ref{fig:vectorplot} and \ref{fig:streamplot} is that as $T_a$ gets smaller the vectors lose their $\phi$ component and in the limit all trajectories (in the stream) become horizontal. Taking the limit of equation \ref{eq:44} 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:16}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{T_a \to 0}} \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} = \frac{\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}}{\theta^{5/2}}- \frac{5 (\frac{d\theta}{d\eta})^2}{2 \theta}  \Longrightarrow \frac{d v}{d \theta} =\theta^{5/2}-\frac{5v}{2\theta} \text{ where, } v =\frac{d \theta}{d \eta} \\
\Longrightarrow v = {\frac{1}{\theta^{3/2}} + \frac{c_0}{\theta^{5/2}}} \Longrightarrow \int \frac{d\theta}{\frac{1}{\theta^{3/2}} + \frac{\phi_0}{\theta^{5/2}}} = \int d\eta.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where we have added the index 0 to $\phi_0$ to show it is an initial value. This agrees with the solution from equation \ref{eq:10} in the case that $\phi_0 = 0$. The integral evolving $\theta$ does have an expression, but can however not be inverted. I will include it here for completeness. To construct a formula of the trajectories of $\theta$ and $\phi$ one would have to numerically calculate the inverse and construct $\phi$ using equation \ref{eq:12}.  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:17}
   \Big[ \frac{2}{15} \sqrt{\theta} \left(3 \theta^2-5 \phi_0 \theta+15 \phi_0{}^2\right)-2 \phi_0{}^{5/2} \tan ^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\theta/\phi_0}\right) \Big]_{\theta_0}^{\theta} = \eta
\end{equation}
For the large limit $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ we can start the analysis via the top half in equation \ref{eq:17} once more.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:18}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} = \frac{-(3+q_1)}{\theta}(\frac{d\theta}{d\eta})^2 \Longrightarrow \int_{}^{} \frac{1}{v} \, dv = \int_{}^{} \frac{-(3+q_1)}{\theta} \, d\theta \\
\text{where } v = \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}\Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta) = \big((4+q_1)\eta+c_1\big)^{1/(4+q_1)}c2\\
\text{ and } \phi_s(\eta) = \frac{1}{2} c_2{}^6 ((q_1+4) \eta-c_1){}^{\frac{6}{q_1+4}-1}-c_2 ((q_1+4) \eta-c_1){}^{\frac{1}{q_1+4}}\\
\text{where } c_1 = \frac{\theta_0^{7/2}}{\theta_0+\phi_0} \text{ and } c_2 = \theta_0 c_1^{\frac{-1}{4+q_1}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From equation \ref{eq:10} it is clear that $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = 0$, by not imposing this on equation \ref{eq:43} we manage to produce analytic functions that almost exactly follow the full models predictions as shown in figure \ref{fig_6} \textcolor{red}{Why is this allowed?? How is this possible}. One can tediously verify these equations are solutions to the vector differential equations as expected (including the auxiliary variable $\phi$) in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ for the limit $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ as long as additional constraints are placed on the constants in equation \ref{eq:15}. From equation \ref{eq:13} we see 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:19}
\begin{split}
  \lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d \phi}{d\eta}=  -\frac{(\theta+\phi) (2 q_1 \theta+2 q_1 \phi+3 \theta+\phi)}{2 \theta^{7/2}}\\
\text{ trivially } \lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = \frac{\theta + \phi}{\theta^{(5/2)}}\\
    \text{to verify } \frac{d \phi}{d\eta}(\theta_s, \phi_s) = \frac{d \phi_s}{d\eta} \text{ and }  \frac{d \theta}{d\eta}(\theta_s, \theta_s) = \frac{d \phi_s}{d\eta}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{image6.png}
    \caption{In blue, orange and green are $\theta$, $\frac{1}{\theta}$ and $\phi$ as produced by the full model. In red and black are the analytic functions made under the assumption $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ from equation \ref{eq:15}. $\theta$ and $\theta_a$ are in-discernibly close to one another until the model crosses the electronic ablation front (around $\eta = 14$), the same holds true for $\phi$ and $\phi_a$. The same values were used as in figure \ref{fig:vectorplot}.}
    \label{fig_6}
\end{figure}
We will now consider the $\theta$ limits near 0 (approaching from the positive side). From equation \ref{eq:13} one can see 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:20}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{\theta \to 0^+}} \frac{{d\theta}}{{d\eta}} = \infty \text{ and }
\lim_{{\theta \to 0}} \frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}} = 
&\begin{cases}
    0 &  q_1 > 3 \\
    -\infty &  \frac{3}{2} < q_1 < 3 
\end{cases}  \\
\text{but } \lim_{{\theta \to 0^+}}\frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}}/\frac{{d\theta}}{{d\eta}} = 0 \text{ if } q1 > \frac{1}{2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is relevant since a value of for the material parameter $q_1 < 3$ is quite reasonable but a value of $q_1 < \frac{1}{2}$ is not. This implies that all vectors in the neighbourhood of $\theta = 0$ are horizontal. Since in the limit near $\theta$ equation \ref{eq:10} contains infinities, we can not use this equation to gain further insight in this case. Instead however, we look at the shift between the dominant vector components however, found by solving the equation $\frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}} = \frac{{d\theta}}{{d\eta}}$ for $\theta <T_a/T_t$. The solution (besides the trivial solution discussed earlier $\phi = -\theta$) is to long to write down but simplifies significantly when a specific value of $q_1$ is chosen, for example 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
    \phi(\theta) = A \theta^{-2.25} - \theta, \text{  where } A = .307 \frac{\kappa_{s,a}} {\kappa_{r,a}}T_a ^{-5.75} 
\end{equation}
for a value of $q_1 = 2.75$. This function $\phi(\theta)$ defines a boundary in the Hamiltonian flow diagram. To the left of $\phi(\theta)$ (but above $\phi = -\theta$) the horizontal component is dominant and to the right the vertical component is dominant. For smaller values of $A$, $\phi(\theta)$ gets pulled closer to the $\phi$ axis meaning that for values of $T_A > 1$ ev, the transition between dominant vector components lies very close to the $\phi$ axis. In our model  $\phi(\theta)$ looks like a combination of the line $\phi$ = 0 and $\phi = \theta$, joined together. \textcolor{red}{Should i include this plot?}. Moving on the the large $\theta$ limit we start from equation \ref{eq:12} out by assuming that in the limit $ \lim_{{\theta \to \infty}} \theta >> \phi$ so that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:22}
\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = \frac{\theta + \phi}{\theta^{(5/2)}}
\Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta) = \big( \frac{5}{2} (\eta - c_1)\big)^{\frac{2}{5}}, \quad c_1 = \theta_0^{5/2}.
\end{equation}
Inserting this solution into $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:13} in the domain $\theta> T_t/T_a$ the result is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:23}
    \frac{d\phi}{d\eta} = -\beta_a \big( \frac{5}{2} (\eta + c_1)\big)^{\frac{2}{5}\times\frac{-3}{2}} \Longrightarrow \phi_s(\eta) = -\beta_a \big( \frac{5}{2} (\eta + c_1)\big)^{\frac{2}{5}} +\phi_0.
\end{equation}
This would imply $ \lim_{{\theta \to \infty}} \theta >> \phi$ is not true in the limit, but since $\phi$ has the same exponent as $\theta$ we could essential "absorb" $\phi$ into $\theta$ in equation \ref{eq:20}, as a result we would only be off by a multiplicative constant in  equation \ref{eq:20}. To derive the real constant we assume $\theta(\eta) = A \eta^{2/5}$ and therefore $\phi = (\frac{2}{5} A^{7/2} - A)\eta^{2/5}$ and insert it into the second order differential equation in the domain $\theta > T_a/T_t$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:24}
\begin{split}
   \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2}= \frac{-2 \beta_t \theta_R^4+2 \beta_t \theta^4+2 \theta^{11/2} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta}-5 \theta^7 \frac{d\theta}{d\eta}^2}{2 \theta^8}\\
   {\theta \to A \eta^{2/5}} \Longrightarrow \frac{-6A}{25}\eta^{-8/5}=(\frac{2}{5}A^{-3/2}-\frac{2}{5}A+\beta_t A^{-4})\eta^{-8/5}\\
   \beta_t = \frac{2}{25} A^{5/2} \left(2 A^{5/2}-5\right) \Longrightarrow A = \left(\frac{5}{4} \pm \sqrt{1+ 4\beta_t} \right) ^{2/5}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we used that $\theta_R$ becomes negligible in the limit $ \lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$.
We will also consider the limiting behaviour of $\lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$ in the domain $\theta < T_a/T_t$. In the large $\phi$ limit equation \ref{eq:13} becomes 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:25}
\begin{split}
    \frac{d\phi}{d\eta} = -A \phi^2 \Longrightarrow \phi_s(\eta) = \frac{1}{1/\phi_0+ A\eta} \text{ where } A = \frac{2 q_1 + 1}{{2 \theta_0 ^3 \left(\sqrt{\theta_0 }+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}T_a^{-3} \left(\theta_0  T_a\right){}^{-q_1}\right)}} \\
  \Longrightarrow \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} =  \frac{\theta^{-5/2}}{1/\phi_0+ A\eta}  \Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta)= \left(\frac{7}{2A}\log (A \phi_0 \eta+1)+\theta_0^{7/2}\right)^{2/7}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we used the index $0$ to indicate starting values. Note that since $\phi$ is inversely proportional to $\eta$ the system rapidly diverges away from the  $ \lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$ and this approximation is only valid very near $\eta = 0$ see figure \ref{fig_5}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{image5.png}
    \caption{In blue and orange are $\theta$ and $\phi$ as produced by the full model. In red and green are the analytic functions made under the assumption $\lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$. Note that both $\theta$ and $\theta_a$ have been scaled by 5000. The rapid divergence from the assumption model is caused by the divergent behaviour near $\eta = 0$.}
    \label{fig_5}
\end{figure}
Considering the same limit in the domain domain $\theta > T_t/T_a$ is simple since $\frac{d \phi}{d \eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:12} does not depend on $\phi$. Therefore 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:26}
\begin{split}
    \phi_s(\eta) = A \eta + \phi_0 \text{ where } A=  \beta_{a} \big(\theta_0^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta_0^{\frac{-11}{2}} \\
\Longrightarrow  \theta^{5/2} d\theta=(A \eta + \phi_0) d\eta \Longrightarrow  \theta_s(\eta) = \big(\theta_0^{7/2} + \frac{7}{4} A \eta^2 + \frac{7}{2} \phi_0 \eta\big)^{2/7}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
since in the limit $\lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$, $\phi_0 >> A$. This simplifies to $\theta(\eta) = \big(\theta_0^{7/2} + \frac{7}{2} \phi_0 \eta\big)^{2/7}$. For both domains in the case $\lim_{{\phi \to 0}}$ the differential equations do not depend on $\phi$ and the arguments follow similar reasoning as in equation \ref{eq:34}. For $\theta < T_t/T_a$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:27}
\begin{split}
       \phi_s(\eta) = A \eta + \phi_0 \text{ where } A = -\frac{(3 q_1 + 2) T_a}{{2 \left(\theta_0  T_a\right)^{-q_1} \left(\sqrt{\theta_0 }+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}T_a^{-3} \left(\theta_0  T_a\right)^{-q_1}\right)}} \\
       \theta_s(\eta) = (\frac{5}{2} \eta + \theta_0)^{2/5}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and for  $\theta \geq T_t/T_a$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:28}
\begin{split}
       \phi_s(\eta) = A \eta + \phi_0 \text{ where } A = \frac{\beta_t \left(\theta_0^4-\theta_R^4\right)}{\theta_0^{11/2}} \\
       \theta_s(\eta) = (\frac{5}{2} \eta + \theta_0)^{2/5}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Domains in phase diagram}
In figure 3 it is clear that there are 3 types of trajectories: trajectories that end up on the bottom left side, trajectories that end up on the right hand side that have passed through the electronic ablation front at $\theta = 1$ and trajectories that end up on the right hand side but don't pass through the ablation front. Trajectories that end up on the bottom left side are non-physical and for those trajectories both $\phi$ and $\theta$ will diverge to infinity in finite $\eta$. Of the 2 leftover cases, the trajectories that start in $\theta < T_a/T_t$ are much more important for the analysis in this paper. And since equation \ref{eq:15} models the full model so well in exactly that domain (see figure \ref{fig_6}). We will be considering it more in depth here. starting from equation \ref{eq:15} (and carrying over the definitions of $c_1$ and $c_2$) we get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:29}
    \theta({\eta}) =1 \Longrightarrow \eta = \frac{c_1^{-(q_1+4)}-c_2}{q_1+4}, \quad c_1 = \frac{\theta_0^{7/2}}{\theta_0+\phi_0} \text{ and } c_2 = \frac{\theta_0}{c_1^{\frac{1}{4+q_1}}}.
\end{equation}
Which is is an expression for the total distance to the ablation front as a function of the starting values of the trajectory (and $q_1$). We compare these values corresponding to the $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ with $T_a$ values on the order of unity in figure \ref{heatplots}. Inspired by the accuracy of the analytic model represented in figure \ref{fig_5} we seek to extend its succes to $\theta \geq T_t/T_a$ where immediately after we cross the ablation front $\theta_0 = T_t/T_a$ and $\phi_0 = \phi_s(\eta(\theta))$ evaluated at $\theta = T_t/T_a$ .

\section{Basko}
In his paper M. M. Basko \cite{Basko2015} describes a more generalised model which instead of equation \ref{eq:12} uses the following formulation 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:30}
\begin{split}
\Theta^n \frac{d\Theta}{d\bar{x}} = \bar{S_r} + (1 - \phi_r)q \Theta^{\beta/\alpha} \\
\Theta^m \frac{d\bar{S_r}}{d\bar{x}} = \lambda_r ( \Gamma_r \Theta^4 - \bar{J_r})\\
\Theta^m \frac{d\bar{J_r}}{d\bar{x}} = -3\lambda_r \bar{S_r}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
taken from eq 54, 61 and 62 respectively. Rewriting these to the notation used in this paper in the shape of eq \ref{eq:12}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:31}
\begin{split}
\frac{d \theta}{d\eta} = (\phi + \frac{19}{20}\theta^{16/9})\theta^{-5/2}\\
=
\frac{d\phi}{d\eta} =\begin{cases} -\frac{d}{d\eta}\big(\frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}(\theta T_{a})^{5/2}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} \big) & \theta < T_t/T_a \\
 \beta_a(\theta^4-\theta_r^4)\theta^{-25/9}   &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a. \\
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We've inserted the values provided in the paper for the tin case $\alpha = \frac{9}{10}, \beta = \frac{16}{10}, q = \frac{19}{20}, n=\frac{5}{2}, m=\frac{25}{9}$ and set the radiative temperature to a constant across the domain as we've assumed in our paper. We've set $\beta_a = \lambda_r \Gamma_r $ and $\theta_r =  (\bar{J_r}/\Gamma_r)^{1/4} $. In this paper's analysis we have implicitly assumed that all the radiation was absorbed just before $y = 0$ which implies $\phi_r = 0$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Baskocase1.png}
    \caption{In blue, orange and green are $\theta$, $\frac{1}{\theta}$ and $\phi$ as produced by the Basko model with the same values used as in image \ref{fig_2}, note the scale change of the y-axis.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Baskocase2.png}
    \caption{The streamplot produced by the Basko model. Superimposed in red is the parameterization of $\theta$ and $\phi$ from figure \ref{fig_7}. The boundary at which $\frac{d \theta}{d \eta} = 0$ and $\frac{d \phi}{d \eta} = 0$ now lies on the function  $\phi = -\frac{19}{20} \theta^{16/9}$ for $\theta < 1$.}
    \label{fig_8}
\end{figure}
Reinserting the expression for $\frac{d \phi}{ d\eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:37}, going to a single second order differential equation and solving for $\frac{d^2 \theta}{d \eta^2}$ in the same way as was done for equation \ref{eq:15}. We reach the following expression 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:32}
\begin{split}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{d \eta^2} =
    \frac{\frac{d \theta}{d \eta} \left(-225 \kappa_s \theta^{5/2} \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}+152 \kappa_s \theta^{16/9}-225 \kappa_r (T_a \theta)^{5/2} \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}\right)}{90 \theta \left(\kappa_s \theta^{5/2}+\kappa_r (T_a \theta)^{5/2}\right)}\\
\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} = \frac{-5}{2\theta}(\frac{d\theta}{d\eta})^2 \Longrightarrow \int_{}^{} \frac{1}{v} \, dv = \int_{}^{} \frac{-5}{2\theta} \, d\theta \\
\theta_s(\eta) = \theta_0^{5/7} c_1^{2/7} \left(\theta_0/c_1+7/2\eta\right)^{2/7}
\text{where } c_1 = \frac{\phi_0 + \frac{19}{20} \theta_0^{16/9}}{\theta_0^{5/2}} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Cretin}
In the study of laser-produced tin plasma's, testing of the applicability of the theory of double ablation fronts is a necessity. For this purpose we employed a robust and versatile simulation tool. The Cretin software package, developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at the direction of Dr. Howard A. Scott, stands out as an excellent candidate. This multi-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiation transfer code provides a comprehensive framework suitable for modelling laboratory plasma's.

At the heart of Cretin's utility is its competence in atomic kinetics and radiation transfer. This capability is the main reason we chose Cretin over for example RALEF, considering our focus on the intricacies of tin plasma's under laser-induced conditions. By handling detailed atomic level populations and transition rates, Cretin provides insights into the opacities, emissivities, heat capacities, and conduction coefficients of the plasma. These aspects are integral to understanding the plasma's behaviour, especially when investigating the stability and efficiency of EUV generation.

A critical aspect of our research is understanding the radiation transport-induced double ablation fronts in densely laser-produced tin plasmas. Here, Cretin’s treatment of atomic kinetics and radiation transfer emerges as particularly relevant. By encompassing most common atomic processes such as excitation and ionization, Cretin allows for a nuanced simulation of the plasma state. Furthermore, its division of radiation transfer into three phases - continuum, lines, and spectral radiation - facilitates a comprehensive analysis. The spectral radiation phase produces detailed plasma spectra without influencing the rest of the simulation, thereby enabling an accurate representation of the plasma conditions.

In summary, the Cretin software package emerges as an indispensable tool in our study of tin plasmas. Its comprehensive approach to simulating atomic kinetics and radiation transfer, combined with its flexible and detailed post-processing capabilities, aligns seamlessly with the objectives of our research. By leveraging Cretin's strengths, we aim to deepen our understanding of the double ablation fronts in tin plasmas, contributing significantly to the field of plasma physics and EUV lithography technology.

On top of Cretin we've build the so-called \href{https://github.com/bowiebrewster/cretin_package}{Cretin front end} to make the operating of Cretin smoother. The capabilities of the front end include easily readable code written in python, drop-down menus explaining the purpose of functions. Looping over any combinations of variable sets included in simulations. The fronted allows searching of the generator files written by Dr Scott. Large parts of the documentation are available in JSON format for help with producing graphical output. The front end automatically creates an environment to run cretin in, writes the generator file that cretin takes as input, runs cretin with that generator file, reads the output that cretin produces and turns that into graphical output including heat plots and animated plots.

\section{Footnote: radiative transfer equation}
The derivation in this section recounts arguments from \cite{MihalasMihalas1984}. The equation of radiative transfer in its most general form  describes a beam of light travelling through a medium subject to the effects of absorption, emission and scattering. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:33}
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{c}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}I_{\nu }+{\hat {\Omega }}\cdot \nabla I_{\nu }+(k_{\nu ,s}+k_{\nu ,a})\rho I_{\nu }=j_{\nu }\rho +{\frac {1}{4\pi }}k_{\nu ,s}\rho \int _{\Omega }I_{\nu }d\Omega }
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light, $j_{\nu}$ is the emission coefficient, $k_{\nu, s}$ is the scattering opacity, $k_{\nu, a}$ is the absorption opacity, $\rho$ is the mass density of the material, the subscript $\nu$ indicates a frequency dependency, the subscripts $a$ and $s$ are used to differentiate between scattering and absorption, and the rightmost term represents radiation scattered from other directions onto a surface. We start out by assuming a static medium $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}I_{\nu} = 0$, no scattering $k_{v,s} = 0$ and a 1d medium ${\hat {\Omega }}\cdot \nabla \rightarrow \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:34}
    (\frac{\partial}{\partial z} +\rho k_{\nu ,a}) I_{\nu} = \rho j_{\nu} 
\end{equation}
In the literature, the source function $S$ and the optical depth $\tau$ are defined in the following way to allow for a more concise formula.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:35}
    S_{\nu} = \frac{j_{\nu}}{k_{\nu,a}}, \quad d\tau_{\nu} = -\rho {k_{\nu,a}} dz, \quad  \frac{\partial I_{\nu}}{\partial \tau_{\nu}} = I_{\nu}-S_{\nu}
\end{equation}

Furthermore if the medium is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), then $S_\nu = B_{\nu}(T)$; the Planckian distribution. If the medium is composed of grey material (one whose absorption coefficient is independent of frequency) all frequency dependency can be integrated out which in the Planckian yields the well know Stefan's law.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:36}
\displaystyle B_{\nu }(\nu ,T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\frac {1}{\exp \left({\frac {h\nu }{k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}\right)-1}}  ,\quad \frac{\partial I}{\partial \tau} = I-\sigma T^4
\end{equation}
where $h$ is Plank's constant, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Note that $T = T(\tau)$. The solution to this differential equation is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:37}
    I(\tau) = e^{\tau }\left( c_1 - \sigma \int _1^{\tau }e^{-t}  T(t)^4dt \right).
\end{equation}
If we assume the diffusion limit is reached such that the optical depth is large and photon mean free paths are small $\tau_\nu >>1,\quad S_\nu \rightarrow B_\nu$, the source function can be Taylor expanded in the following way 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:38}
    S_{\nu}(t_\nu) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B^{n}_{\nu}(\tau_{\nu})(t_{\nu}-\tau_{\nu})^n/n!
\end{equation}
where $B^{n}_{\nu}(\tau_{\nu})$ is the nth derivative of the Planckian distribution. Similarly the flux $H_\nu(\tau_\nu)$ (using Eddington notation) can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:39}
    H_\nu(\tau_\nu) = \frac{\partial B_\nu}{3 \partial \tau_\nu} + \frac{\partial^3 B_\nu}{5 \partial \tau^3_\nu}+...
\end{equation}
Which by the same diffusion limits assumption allows us to ignore higher order terms. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:40}
    H_\nu(\tau_\nu) = \frac{\partial B_\nu}{3 \partial \tau_\nu} = -\frac{1}{3} \frac{\partial B_\nu}{ \partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\rho {k_{\nu,a}} \partial z} 
\end{equation}
where we used equation \ref{eq:25}. Integrating out the frequency in equation \ref{eq:30} naturally leads us to the Rosseland mean free path $l_r$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:41}
\begin{aligned}
    H(\tau) &=  \int_{0}^{\infty}  H(\tau_{\nu})d\nu = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{\partial T}{\rho  \partial z} \int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{\partial B_\nu}{ \partial T} \frac{1}{{k_{\nu,a}}} d\nu \\
      &= \frac{1}{3 \rho}\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\frac{\frac{\partial B}{\partial T}}{\int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{\partial B_\nu}{ \partial T} d\nu}\int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{\partial B_\nu}{ \partial T} \frac{1}{{k_{\nu,a}}}  \\
      &=  \frac{1}{3 \rho}\frac{\partial B}{\partial z}\frac{1}{l_r}, \text{ where } \frac{1}{l_r} = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k_{\nu, a}} \cdot B_{\nu}(T) \, d\nu}{\int_{0}^{\infty} B_{\nu}(T) \, d\nu},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
furthermore if we define the effective radiative conductivity $K_R$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:42}
   K_R = \frac{1}{3 \rho} \int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{\partial B_\nu}{ \partial T} \frac{1}{{k_{\nu,a}}} d\nu = \frac{1}{3\rho l_r} \frac{\partial B}{\partial T} \rightarrow H(\tau) = -K_R \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
which shows that in an opaque medium the radiant heat flux has the same mathematical form as molecular heat conduction in a gas as described by Fick's law.

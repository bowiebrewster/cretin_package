\section{Introduction}
In order to sustain Moore's Law in the semiconductor industry, Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) has become a key technology in mass manufacturing of today's most sophisticated integrated circuits \cite{Bakshi2018EUVLithography}. In the pursuit of more efficient sources of EUV radiation \cite{Fomenkov2017AdvOptTechnol}, laser--produced plasma (LPP) has been investigated as a potential method. Tin (Sn) plasmas have received special attention because of their ability to create EUV light in the in band wavelength range of 13.5 nm$\pm 1\%$. The strong reflectivity of the molybdenum/silicon multi--layer reflectors in this in--band region makes this wavelength ideal for energetically efficient laser--output.

The most effective way to produce this radiation is to focus high--intensity CO$_{2}$ laser light onto pre--shaped tin micro droplet targets, resulting in a laser--produced plasma (LPP). The plasma contains large populations of Sn$^{11+} - $ Sn$^{15+}$ ions which generate intense, narrow band EUV radiation through bound--bound atomic transitions \cite{Torretti2020}\cite{Scheers2020}. The laser wavelength sets the critical electron density according to $n_{e, cr} \propto \lambda_{laser}^{-2}$, determining the densities for which EUV radiation is generated\cite{Hemminga2023} \cite{Basko2016}. 

At densities smaller than $n_c$ the plasma is transparent to the laser light. The surface in the plasma at which the electron density is close to $n_c$ defines a thin critical surface in which the laser energy is absorbed \cite{2016}. The rapid heating of this thin slice of the material will cause it to ablate in the direction of the laser from which it was hit (outward in the case of our droplet). In the dynamics of these plasmas, 3 types of heat transfer play a key role; convective, electronic and radiative. We can somewhat loosely define the "ablation regime" by the condition where $S_r/I_L \geq 0.1-0.2$ where $S_r$ is the energy flux carried by radiation and $I_L$ is the incident laser energy flux.

\end{figure}
Under these circumstances, studying the structure of quasi--stationary ablation frontsâ€”that is, ablation fronts whose structure evolves slowly over time becomes valuable for modelling the behaviour of tin plasmas. Radiating plasma structures (RPS) were originally discovered in simulations by by Dahlburg \textit{et al}\cite{Dahlburg1995} \cite{Hazak1999}. More recently the one-dimensional analytical theory of single ablation fronts has received considerable attention. Research has delved into unsteady self-similar solutions focusing solely on electron heat conduction\cite{Garnier2006}. The steady, isobaric ablation front model proposed by Kull \cite{Kull1989} has been employed for examining the Rayleigh--Taylor instability at ablation fronts. Kull's model is used in Sanz's theory of double ablation fronts \cite{Sanz2009} which we will be expanding upon in the current work.

In this study, we investigate the details of radiation transport--induced double ablation fronts in dense laser--produced tin plasmas. Our goal is to understand the intricate relationships that allow for the emergence of double ablation fronts in these plasmas. Through the use of theoretical models and simulations using the Cretin software package supplied by the Lawrence Livermore national laboratory.

In his paper, D. Hemminga \textit{et al}\cite{Hemminga2023} explored the impact of laser intensity on the formation and power partitioning of tin plasmas. How the density changes spatially in reaction to higher laser intensities is of particular interest for this research. Varying the laser intensity, specifically in the range 50-500 MW/cm$^2$, modifies the plasmas physical characteristics, including its mass density, electron density, temperature and the critical electron density contour. These modifications, in turn, influence the EUV light generation efficiency, a critical parameter for EUVL applications.

We show the density data from figure 5 from \cite{Hemminga2023} in figure \ref{fig_1}. It is shown that with increasing laser intensity, there is a discernible shift in the plasmas mass density profile, particularly in proximity to the ablation front. Higher intensities appear to cause what we will later in this paper identify as an ablation front. The interplay between radiative, electronic and convective heat transfer is responsible for sustaining stable double ablation fronts, which are essential for consistent and efficient EUV generation. In this paper we research if this hump indicates the forming of an ablation front and if we can theoretically predict when an ablation front forms.

\section{Theory of ablation fronts}
In this thesis, we describe a one--dimensional analytical model of double ablation fronts in a differential phase context based on the work of Sanz, Drean and Yaez \cite{Sanz2009} \cite{Drean2010} \cite{Yaez2011} \cite{Yaez2012}. When solving a hydrodynamics problem of this kind an appropriate first step is to take a look at the general Navier--Stokes equations for a compressible liquid including radiative transfer.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{d \rho}{d t} +\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \rho = 0 &\text{Mass conservation} \\
&\rho \left( \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{d t} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla P + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\tau} + \rho \mathbf{g} - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{P}_{\text{rad}} &\text{Momentum equation} \\
&\frac{d}{d t} \left( \epsilon \rho + \frac{1}{2} \rho \mathbf{v}^2 \right) + \nabla \cdot \left[ \frac{1}{2}  (\mathbf{v}^2 + w) \rho \mathbf{v} - \rho c_p \chi \nabla T \right] = \rho \mathbf{g} \cdot \mathbf{v} &\text{Energy equation}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the density, $v$ is the velocity, $P$ is the pressure, $\tau$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration (or other source of homogeneous acceleration) and $P_{rad}$ is the radiation pressure tensor. Furthermore, $\epsilon$ is the specific energy, $w$ is the specific enthalpy, $\chi$ is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity which is assumed to obey the power law $\chi \propto T^\alpha \rho^\beta$

To avoid having to solve a millennium prize problem for this master thesis we collapse the problem down to one dimension and assume a steady state (constant in time) description of the problem excluding viscous dissipation.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:47}
\begin{split}
\frac{d}{d y}(\rho v) = 0 \longrightarrow v \rho = c_0\\
\frac{d}{d y}\left((\frac{1}{2}v^2 + w)\rho v- \rho c_p \chi \frac{d T}{dy} \right) = \rho g v\\
\longrightarrow \frac{d}{d y}\left((\frac{1}{2}v^2 + w) c_0- c_0 c_p \chi/v \frac{d T}{dy} \right) = c0 g\\
\end{split}    
\end{equation}
Along the same lines as Kull and Sanz \cite{Kull1989} \cite{Sanz2009} we assume equal electron and ion temperatures and a single ion species with atomic number \( A \) and charge state \( Z \). Then the pressure \( P \), the specific internal energy \( \varepsilon \) , the specific enthalpy $w$ and the specific heat at constant pressure $c_p$ are given by the relations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:48}
    P = \frac{\rho T}{m}, \quad
    \varepsilon = \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \frac{T}{m}, \quad
    w = c_p T = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \frac{T}{m},
\end{equation}
where \( m = m_p A / (1 + Z) \), \( m_p \) denotes the proton mass, and
\( \gamma = \frac{5}{3} \) is the adiabaticity index. The isobaric approximation assumes a constant pressure across the entire domain, as a result the momentum equation is void and is omitted in equation \ref{eq:47}. From equations \ref{eq:47} and \ref{eq:48} we define the following relations between the density, velocity and temperature with respect to their values at the ablation front indicated with a subscript 'a'
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
P = P_{a},
\quad\text{}\quad 
\rho \nu  = \rho_{a} \nu_{a}
\quad\text{and}\quad 
\rho T = \rho_{a}T_{a}.
\end{equation}
Using these equations we introduce an auxiliary variable $\theta$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
\theta = \frac{T}{T_{a}} = \frac{\nu}{\nu_{a}} = \frac{\rho_{a}}{\rho}.
\end{equation}
The ablation front is assumed to be steady, meaning that all functions are assumed to be constant in time. This description can be considered appropriate inside a layer in the vicinity of the maximum density gradient. For our analysis, the tin plasmas usually have diameters ranging from 20 to 50 micrometers. This suggests a flow dimension approximately 10 micrometers, which is comparable to the smallest diameters of laser focal spots. The usual flow speed is determined by the sound speed in the plasma created by the laser, estimated to be between $(5-10)  \times 10^5 T(ev)^{1/2}$, resulting in a characteristic time of about 0.1 to 0.2 nanoseconds. Therefore, in many scenarios, the ablation flow can achieve a steady state with laser pulses as brief as 1 nanosecond. \cite{Basko2015}

The first ablation front is defined to be located at y = 0. Note that in one dimension. momentum conservation does not need to be imposed since it follows from the isobaric approximation \cite{Sanz2009}. Starting from equation \ref{eq:47}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
\begin{split}
    \frac{1}{2}v^2 \rightarrow S_r, \quad \frac{5}{2} \chi /v \rightarrow \kappa_s, \quad g\rightarrow 0\\
    \frac{d}{dy} \big(\frac{5}{2}T - \kappa_{s}(T)\frac{dT}{dy}\big) = -\frac{dS_{r}}{dy},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $S_r$ is the radiative flux, $g$ goes to zero since we are in the slab frame and $\kappa_{s}$ is the Spitzer thermal conductivity which we normalise with respect its value at the ablation front.
$\frac{5}{2}P_a\nu$, $\kappa_{s}(T)\frac{dT}{dy}$ and $\frac{dS_{r}}{dy}$ respectively represent the convective, electronic and radiative heat transfer. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
    \kappa_{s}  = \kappa_{s,a}\big(\frac{T}{T_{a}}\big)^{5/2}.
\end{equation}
where we have implicitly assumed that the $\chi$ power-law obeys $\alpha - \beta - 1 = 5/2$.
In Sanz's model the derivative of the radiative energy flux $S_{r}(power/area)$ is discontinuous at the boundary between the optically thin and optically thick regimes. The optically thick radiative flux equation follows Fick's law and is derived in the appendix on the radiative transfer equation. The optically thin radiative flux equation behaves like a black body.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
\frac{dS_{r}}{dy}=\begin{cases}
			 -\frac{d}{dy}\big( \kappa_{r}(T)\frac{dT}{dy}\big), & T < T_{t}\\
            4 \sigma K_{P} \big(T^{4} - T_{r}^{4}  \big), &  T  \geq T_{t},
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation} where $\sigma$ is the Stefan--Boltzmann constant,
$\kappa_{r}$ is the Rosseland thermal conductivity, and $K_{p}$ is the Planck mean volume opacity. In this analysis the radiative temperature $T_r$ is assumed constant across the spatial domain. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
\kappa_{r} = \kappa_{r,a} T^{q_{1}+3}
  \quad\text{and}\quad 
  K_{P} = K_{P,a}\Bigl(\frac{T}{T_{a}}\Bigl)^{\frac{-11}{2}}.
\end{equation}
$q_1$ is a material constant that usually lies in the range $1<q_1<4$. An exact formula for the Planck mean volume opacity can be found in \cite{ZeldovichRaizer1966} where it is a function of the density, however due to the isobaric assumption, equation \ref{eq:6} is valid. For simplicity, we assign each type of heat transfer its own parameter: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
\begin{split}
a  \equiv \frac{5}{2}P_{a}\nu_{a},
   \quad\quad 
b  \equiv \kappa_{s,a}T_{a},
   \quad\quad 
c \equiv \sigma T_{a}^{4},
   \quad\quad 
   \\
L_{a}  \equiv \frac{b}{a},
   \quad\quad 
Bo_{a}  \equiv \frac{a}{c},
   \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
 where $ a,b $ and $ c $ are the coupling for the convective, electronic and radiative heating respectively, $L$ is the characteristic length for electronic thermal diffusion and $Bo$ is the Boltzmann number, a dimensionless parameter measuring the relative importance of convective and radiative heat transfer. Using equation \ref{eq:2} we can make the energy conservation equations \ref{eq:3} and \ref{eq:5} into a one dimensional (only depending on the variable $\theta$) second order differential equation.
 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
\frac{d}{dy} \big(a\theta -b\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{dy}\big)=\begin{cases}
			-\frac{d}{dy}\big(\kappa_{r,a}T_{a}(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{dy}\big), & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
           c K_{P,a} \big(\theta^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a,
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\theta_r = T_r/T_a$ and is assumed constant across the spatial domain. Multiplying both sides of equation \ref{eq:8} with $\frac{b}{a^2}$ and taking the derivative with respect to the new parameter $\eta = y/L_{a}$ such that $\frac{d f(y)}{dy} = \frac{1}{L_{a}}\frac{d f(y)}{d\eta}$. The result is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:9}
\frac{d}{d\eta}\big( \theta -\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big) =\begin{cases}
			-\frac{d}{d\eta} \big( \kappa_{r,a} T_{a}/b(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big), & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
           \beta_{a} \big(\theta^{4} -  \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_{a} \equiv \frac{bc}{a^2 K_{P,a}}$. This shape of the equations is particularly nice since in the domain $\theta \geq T_t/T_a$ the only constant left over is  $\beta_{a}$. It should be noted that $\kappa_{r,a}T_a/b= \kappa_{r,a}/\kappa_{s,a} $, this ratio is a material constant that for most materials is roughly equal to 10. In the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ we can remove the differential operators on both sides and solve for $\frac{d \theta}{d \eta}$, 

 


\begin{equation}\label{eq:10}
\begin{split}
    \frac{d \theta}{d \eta} = \big(\theta^{3/2} + c \theta^{q_1+2}\big)^{-1} \text{,  where  } c = \frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}T_a^{q_1+3}\\
    \Longrightarrow\Big[\frac{2}{5}\theta^{5/2}+\frac{c \theta^{q_1+3}}{q_1+3} \Big]_{\theta_0}^{\theta} = \eta. \quad\quad\quad\quad
\end{split}
\end{equation}
If we apply the same transformations that were applied to equation \ref{eq:8} to the radiative flux from equation \ref{eq:3} the result is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:11}
    \frac{d}{d\eta}\big( \theta -\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big) = \frac{d}{d\eta}\frac{-S_r}{a} \equiv - \frac{d\phi}{d\eta}.
\end{equation}
Where we have defined $\phi$ and in doing so have essentially split our second--order differential equation of the variable $\theta$ into two coupled first--order differential equations of the variables $\theta$ and $\phi$, see figure \ref{fig_2}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:12}
\begin{split}
\theta -\theta^{\frac{5}{2} }\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}  =-\phi \Longrightarrow \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = \frac{\theta + \phi}{\theta^{(5/2)}}
\\
\frac{d \phi}{d\eta} =\begin{cases}
			  -\frac{d}{d\eta}\big(\frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}\big), & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
             \beta_{a} \big(\theta^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.
		 \end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

On the left hand side of the transition the medium is optically thick, on the right hand side the medium is optically thin.}

\end{figure}

\section{Phase space flow}
Note the variables left over in equation 12: $\frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}$, $ q_1$ and $T_t$ are all material constants that assuming we intend to use tin as the source in our EUV laser, we would be unable to change. Leftover are $T_a$, $T_r$ and $\beta_a$. These are the only 3 parameters (excluding the initial values of a trajectory) that we could use to change the trajectory defined by our differential equations. Viewing the differential equations from the perspective of equations \ref{eq:12} allows us to create a stream plot of $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ and $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ (a phase space), where we simultaneously show the values of $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$, $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ and the trajectories that follow as a consequence of every initial value. We can not approach this phase space as a Hamiltonian flow since the divergence of the vectors is non--zero. We use the phase space as a tool for generalisation and intuition. To show the phase space additional care must be taken in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ since in a stream plot there can be no derivatives on the right hand side. We insert the expression for $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ from equations \ref{eq:12}, calculate the derivative, solve for $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$, insert  $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ again and show the result for completeness.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:13}
    \frac{d \phi}{d\eta} =\begin{cases}
			 -\frac{T_a^3 (\theta +\phi ) (3 \theta +2 \theta q_1 + 2 q_1 \phi +\phi ) \left(\theta  T_a\right){}^{q_1}}{2 \theta ^3 \left(\sqrt{\theta } T_a^3 \left(\theta  T_a\right){}^{q_1}+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}\right)}, & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
             \beta_{a} \big(\theta^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta^{\frac{-11}{2}}, &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.
		 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
For completeness and later reference we will also write down the 2nd order differential equation as a function of $\theta $ and $ \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:14}
        \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2}=\begin{cases} -\frac{\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} \left(5\frac{\kappa_s}{\kappa_r} \theta^{3/2} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta}-2\frac{\kappa_s}{\kappa_r}+2   ( q_1+3) T_a^3 \theta^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} (T_a \theta)^{ q_1}\right)}{2\frac{\kappa_s}{\kappa_r} \theta^{5/2}+2 T_a^3 \theta^3 (T_a \theta)^{ q_1}}
        & \theta < T_t/T_a\\
        \frac{-2 \beta_t \theta_R^4+2 \beta_t \theta^4+2 \theta^{11/2}\frac{d \theta}{d \eta}-5 \theta^7\frac{d \theta}{d \eta}^2}{2 \theta^8} 
        &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a.\\
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
In figures \ref{fig:vectorplot} and \ref{fig:streamplot} we've set $T_a$ = $T_t$, this implies that the electronic ablation front is located at $\theta = 1$. This marks the clear division between the left--hand side and the right hand--side in these figures. For the same reason the point where $\theta$ and $1/\theta$ cross in figure \ref{fig:streamplot} is the electronic ablation front. Setting both derivatives equal to 0 in equation 13 returns $\theta = -\phi$ as a solution for $\theta < T_t/T_a$. This intuitively comes from $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ having $\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}$ as a divisor for $\theta < T_t/T_a$ in equation 12. This implies that any trajectories that have initial values that fulfil $\theta_0 > -\phi_0$  for $\theta < T_t/T_a$ will never end up on the other side of the line $\theta = -\phi$ (intuitively if there is a region where the velocity of an object is zero, the trajectory of that object could never cross that region, see figure \ref{fig:streamplot}).

\section{Limiting behaviour}
Looking at the non--material parameters from equation \ref{eq:13}, $T_a$, $T_r$ and $\beta_a$, the only parameter present in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ is $T_a$. For this reason we will give additional attention to $T_a$ in this section, considering the following limits of the model looking at it from either the angle of the second order differential equation \ref{eq:10} or the 2 coupled first--order differential equations \ref{eq:12}. We will consider the following limits: 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|X|X|X|}
    \hline
   $\theta <T_t/T_a $ & $\theta$ & $\phi$ & $T_A$ \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to 0}$ & 0  & 2/5  & $2/7$  \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to \infty}$ & NA  & 2/7  &  $1/(4+q_1)$ \\
    \hline
    \hline
    $\theta \geq T_t/T_a $ & $\theta$ & $\phi$ & $T_A$ \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to 0}$ &  NA & 2/5  & NiF  \\
    \hline
    $\lim_{ \to \infty}$ & 2/5  & 4/7  & NiF  \\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{The cases are N/A when the limit we are taking is not inside the domain of the function we are considering. NiF refers to when the variable we are taking the limit of is not inside the function we are considering. The values in the table represent the exponent of the power law scaling of the solutions $\theta(\eta)$ (to leading order) of the differential equations in that particular limit.}
\end{table}
Starting out with the limits of $T_A$ we rewrite equation \ref{eq:13} for the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ in the following way 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:15}
        \frac{d \phi}{d\eta} =
			 -\frac{(\theta +\phi ) (3 \theta +2 \theta q_1 + 2 q_1 \phi +\phi )\theta^{q_1}}{2 \theta ^3 \left(\theta^{(q_1+1/2)}+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}T_a^{-(3+q_1)}\right)}.
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:15} suggest that the limit $\lim_{{T_a \to 0}} \frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}} = 0$ since $q_1 > -3$. What that means in the context of figure \ref{fig:vectorplot} and \ref{fig:streamplot} is that as $T_a$ gets smaller the vectors lose their $\phi$ component and in the limit all trajectories (in the stream) become horizontal. Taking the limit of equation \ref{eq:14} 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:16}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{T_a \to 0}} \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} = \frac{\frac{d\theta}{d\eta}}{\theta^{5/2}}- \frac{5 (\frac{d\theta}{d\eta})^2}{2 \theta}  \Longrightarrow \frac{d v}{d \theta} =\theta^{5/2}-\frac{5v}{2\theta} \text{ where, } v =\frac{d \theta}{d \eta} \\
\Longrightarrow v = {\frac{1}{\theta^{3/2}} + \frac{c_0} {\theta^{5/2}}}  \Longrightarrow \phi = c_0 \Longrightarrow \int \frac{d\theta}{\frac{1}{\theta^{3/2}} + \frac{\phi_0}{\theta^{5/2}}} = \int d\eta.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Where we have added the index 0 to $\phi_0$ to show it is an initial value. This agrees with the solution from equation \ref{eq:10} in the case that $\phi_0 = 0$. The integral evolving $\theta$ does have an expression, but can however not be inverted. We will include it here for completeness. To construct a formula of the trajectories of $\theta$ and $\phi$ one would have to numerically calculate the inverse and construct $\phi$ using equation \ref{eq:12}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:17}
    \Big[\frac{2}{15} \sqrt{\theta} \left(3 \theta^2-5 \phi_0 \theta+15 \phi_0{}^2\right)-2 \phi_0{}^{5/2} \tan ^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\theta/\phi_0}\right)\Big]_{\theta_0}^{\theta}  = \eta(\theta) - \eta(\theta_0)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:43}
    \eta(\theta) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\theta^{n+\frac{5}{2}}(-1)^{n+1}}{(n+\frac{5}{2})\phi_0^{-n}} = \frac{2 \theta^{7/2}}{7 \phi_0}-\frac{2 \theta^{9/2}}{9 \phi_0^2}+...
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{LowTempLimit.png}
    \caption{In blue and Orange are $\theta$ and $\phi$ as produced by the full model at $T_a = 0.1$. In green is the inverse of the 1st order approximation from equation \ref{eq:43}. The same values (except the temperature) are used as in \ref{fig:vectorplot}.}
    \label{fig_8}
\end{figure}

Instead of solving the the differential equation in equation \ref{eq:16} we could have instead looked at equation \ref{eq:9}, guessed $(A \theta(\eta))^{2/5}$ as a solution to equation \ref{eq:16} and found $A = 5/2$. This result still holds true for equation \ref{eq:17} if you take the limit of $\phi_0 \rightarrow 0$. In taking this short--cut we would have left out the effect of different starting conditions in the phase space however. Furthermore for any non zero $\phi$, the leading order is $\frac{2 \theta^{7/2}}{7 \phi_0}$ meaning our inverse at leading order is $(7/2 \eta \phi_0)^{2/7}$. For the large limit $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ we can start the analysis via the top half in equation \ref{eq:17} once more.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:18}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} = \frac{-(3+q_1)}{\theta}(\frac{d\theta}{d\eta})^2 \Longrightarrow \int_{}^{} \frac{1}{v} \, dv = \int_{}^{} \frac{-(3+q_1)}{\theta} \, d\theta \\
\text{where } v = \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}\Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta) = \big((4+q_1)\eta+c_1\big)^{1/(4+q_1)}c2\\
\text{ and } \phi_s(\eta) = \frac{1}{2} c_2{}^6 ((q_1+4) \eta-c_1){}^{\frac{6}{q_1+4}-1}-c_2 ((q_1+4) \eta-c_1){}^{\frac{1}{q_1+4}}\\
\text{where } c_1 = \frac{\theta_0^{7/2}}{\theta_0+\phi_0} \text{ and } c_2 = \theta_0 c_1^{\frac{-1}{4+q_1}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From equation \ref{eq:10} it is clear that $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = 0$, by not imposing this on equation \ref{eq:16} we manage to produce analytic functions that almost exactly follow the full models predictions as shown in figure \ref{fig_6} \textcolor{red}{Why is this allowed?? How is this possible}. One can tediously verify these equations are solutions to the vector differential equations as expected (including the auxiliary variable $\phi$) in the domain $\theta < T_t/T_a$ for the limit $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ as long as additional constraints are placed on the constants in equation \ref{eq:15}. From equation \ref{eq:13} we see 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:19}
\begin{split}
  \lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d \phi}{d\eta}=  -\frac{(\theta+\phi) (2 q_1 \theta+2 q_1 \phi+3 \theta+\phi)}{2 \theta^{7/2}}\\
\text{ trivially } \lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = \frac{\theta + \phi}{\theta^{(5/2)}}\\
    \text{to verify } \frac{d \phi}{d\eta}(\theta_s, \phi_s) = \frac{d \phi_s}{d\eta} \text{ and }  \frac{d \theta}{d\eta}(\theta_s, \theta_s) = \frac{d \phi_s}{d\eta}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{HighTempLimit.png}
    \caption{In blue, orange and green are $\theta$, $\frac{1}{\theta}$ and $\phi$ as produced by the full model. In red and black are the analytic functions made under the assumption $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ from equation \ref{eq:15}. $\theta$ and $\theta_a$ are in--discernibly close to one another until the model crosses the electronic ablation front (around $\eta = 14$), the same holds true for $\phi$ and $\phi_a$. The same values were used as in figure \ref{fig:vectorplot}.}
    \label{fig_6}
\end{figure}
We will now consider the $\theta$ limits near 0 (approaching from the positive side). From equation \ref{eq:13} one can see 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:20}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{\theta \to 0^+}} \frac{{d\theta}}{{d\eta}} = \infty \text{ and }
\lim_{{\theta \to 0}} \frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}} = 
&\begin{cases}
    0 &  q_1 > 3 \\
    -\infty &  \frac{3}{2} < q_1 < 3 
\end{cases}  \\
\text{but } \lim_{{\theta \to 0^+}}\frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}}/\frac{{d\theta}}{{d\eta}} = 0 \text{ if } q1 > \frac{1}{2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is relevant since a value of for the material parameter $q_1 < 3$ is quite reasonable but a value of $q_1 < \frac{1}{2}$ is not. This implies that all vectors in the neighbourhood of $\theta = 0$ are horizontal. Since in the limit near $\theta$ equation \ref{eq:10} contains infinities, we can not use this equation to gain further insight in this case. Instead however, we look at the shift between the dominant vector components however, found by solving the equation $\frac{{d\phi}}{{d\eta}} = \frac{{d\theta}}{{d\eta}}$ for $\theta <T_a/T_t$. The solution (besides the trivial solution discussed earlier $\phi = -\theta$) is to long to write down but simplifies significantly when a specific value of $q_1$ is chosen, for example 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
    \phi(\theta) = A \theta^{-2.25} - \theta, \text{  where } A = .307 \frac{\kappa_{s,a}} {\kappa_{r,a}}T_a ^{-5.75} 
\end{equation}
for a value of $q_1 = 2.75$. This function $\phi(\theta)$ defines a boundary in the phase--space diagram. To the left of $\phi(\theta)$ (but above $\phi = -\theta$) the horizontal component is dominant and to the right the vertical component is dominant. For smaller values of $A$, $\phi(\theta)$ gets pulled closer to the $\phi$ axis meaning that for values of $T_A > 1$ ev, the transition between dominant vector components lies very close to the $\phi$ axis. In Sanz's model  $\phi(\theta)$ looks like a combination of the lines $\phi$ = 0 and $\phi = -\theta$, joined together at $\theta = \phi = 0$. \textcolor{red}{Should i include this plot?}. Moving on the the large $\theta$ limit we start from equation \ref{eq:12} out by assuming that in the limit $ \lim_{{\theta \to \infty}} \theta >> \phi$ so that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:22}
\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = \frac{\theta + \phi}{\theta^{(5/2)}}
\Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta) = \big( \frac{5}{2} (\eta - c_1)\big)^{\frac{2}{5}}, \quad c_1 = \theta_0^{5/2}.
\end{equation}
Inserting this solution into $\frac{d\phi}{d\eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:13} in the domain $\theta> T_t/T_a$ the result is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:23}
    \frac{d\phi}{d\eta} = -\beta_a \big( \frac{5}{2} (\eta + c_1)\big)^{\frac{2}{5}\times\frac{-3}{2}} \Longrightarrow \phi_s(\eta) = -\beta_a \big( \frac{5}{2} (\eta + c_1)\big)^{\frac{2}{5}} +\phi_0.
\end{equation}
This would imply $ \lim_{{\theta \to \infty}} \theta >> \phi$ is not true in the limit, but since $\phi$ has the same exponent as $\theta$ we could essential "absorb" $\phi$ into $\theta$ in equation \ref{eq:20}, as a result we would only be off by a multiplicative constant in  equation \ref{eq:20}. To derive the real constant we assume $\theta(\eta) = A \eta^{2/5}$ and therefore $\phi = (\frac{2}{5} A^{7/2} - A)\eta^{2/5}$ and insert it into the second order differential equation in the domain $\theta > T_a/T_t$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:24}
\begin{split}
   \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2}= \frac{-2 \beta_t \theta_R^4+2 \beta_t \theta^4+2 \theta^{11/2} \frac{d\theta}{d\eta}-5 \theta^7 \frac{d\theta}{d\eta}^2}{2 \theta^8}\\
   {\theta \to A \eta^{2/5}} \Longrightarrow \frac{-6A}{25}\eta^{-8/5}=(\frac{2}{5}A^{-3/2}-\frac{2}{5}A+\beta_t A^{-4})\eta^{-8/5}\\
   \beta_t = \frac{2}{25} A^{5/2} \left(2 A^{5/2}-5\right) \Longrightarrow A = \left(\frac{5}{4} \pm \frac{5}{4} \sqrt{1+ 4\beta_t} \right) ^{2/5}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we used that $\theta_R$ becomes negligible in the limit $ \lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{HighThetaLimit.png}
    \caption{In blue and orange are $\theta$ and $\phi$ as produced by the full model. In green and red are the analytic functions made under the assumption $\lim_{{\theta \to \infty}}$ from equation \ref{eq:24}. The same values are used as in figure \ref{fig:vectorplot}.}
    \label{fig_10}
\end{figure}



We will also consider the limiting behaviour of $\lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$ in the domain $\theta < T_a/T_t$. In the large $\phi$ limit equation \ref{eq:13} becomes 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:25}
\begin{split}
    \frac{d\phi}{d\eta} = -A \phi^2 \Longrightarrow \phi_s(\eta) = \frac{1}{1/\phi_0+ A\eta} \text{ where } A = \frac{2 q_1 + 1}{{2 \theta_0 ^3 \left(\sqrt{\theta_0 }+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}T_a^{-3} \left(\theta_0  T_a\right){}^{-q_1}\right)}} \\
  \Longrightarrow \frac{d\theta}{d\eta} =  \frac{\theta^{-5/2}}{1/\phi_0+ A\eta}  \Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta)= \left(\frac{7}{2A}\log (A \phi_0 \eta+1)+\theta_0^{7/2}\right)^{2/7}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we used the index $0$ to indicate starting values. Note that since $\phi$ is inversely proportional to $\eta$ the system rapidly diverges away from the  $ \lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$ and this approximation is only valid very near $\eta = 0$ see figure \ref{fig_5}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{HighPhiLimit.png}
    \caption{In blue and orange are $\theta$ and $\phi$ as produced by the full model. In red and green are the analytic functions made under the assumption $\lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$. Note that both $\theta$ and $\theta_a$ have been scaled by a factor of 5000. The rapid divergence from the assumption model is caused by the divergent behaviour near $\eta = 0$.}
    \label{fig_5}
\end{figure}
Considering the same limit in the domain domain $\theta > T_t/T_a$ is simple since $\frac{d \phi}{d \eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:12} does not depend on $\phi$. Therefore 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:26}
\begin{split}
    \phi_s(\eta) = A \eta + \phi_0 \text{ where } A=  \beta_{a} \big(\theta_0^{4} - \theta_r^4 \big)\theta_0^{\frac{-11}{2}} \\
\Longrightarrow  \theta^{5/2} d\theta=(A \eta + \phi_0) d\eta \Longrightarrow  \theta_s(\eta) = \big(\theta_0^{7/2} + \frac{7}{4} A \eta^2 + \frac{7}{2} \phi_0 \eta\big)^{2/7}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
since in the limit $\lim_{{\phi \to \infty}}$, $\phi_0 >> A$. This simplifies to $\theta(\eta) = \big(\theta_0^{7/2} + \frac{7}{2} \phi_0 \eta\big)^{2/7}$. For both domains in the case $\lim_{{\phi \to 0}}$ the differential equations do not depend on $\phi$ and the arguments follow similar reasoning as in equation \ref{eq:34}. For $\theta < T_t/T_a$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:27}
\begin{split}
       \phi_s(\eta) = A \eta + \phi_0 \text{ where } A = -\frac{(3 q_1 + 2) T_a}{{2 \left(\theta_0  T_a\right)^{-q_1} \left(\sqrt{\theta_0 }+\frac{\kappa_{s,a}}{\kappa_{r,a}}T_a^{-3} \left(\theta_0  T_a\right)^{-q_1}\right)}} \\
       \theta_s(\eta) = (\frac{5}{2} \eta + \theta_0)^{2/5}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and for  $\theta \geq T_t/T_a$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:28}
\begin{split}
       \phi_s(\eta) = A \eta + \phi_0 \text{ where } A = \frac{\beta_t \left(\theta_0^4-\theta_R^4\right)}{\theta_0^{11/2}} \\
       \theta_s(\eta) = (\frac{5}{2} \eta + \theta_0)^{2/5}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\section{Domains in phase diagram}
In figure 3 it is clear that there are 3 types of trajectories: trajectories that end up on the bottom left side, trajectories that end up on the right hand side that have passed through the electronic ablation front at $\theta = 1$ and trajectories that end up on the right hand side but don't pass through the ablation front. Trajectories that end up on the bottom left side are non--physical and for those trajectories both $\phi$ and $\theta$ will diverge to infinity in finite $\eta$. Of the 2 leftover cases, the trajectories that start in $\theta < T_a/T_t$ are much more important for the analysis in this paper. And since equation \ref{eq:15} models the full model so well in exactly that domain (see figure \ref{fig_6}). We will be considering it more in depth here. starting from equation \ref{eq:15} (and carrying over the definitions of $c_1$ and $c_2$) we get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:29}
    \theta({\eta}) =1 \Longrightarrow \eta = \frac{c_1^{-(q_1+4)}-c_2}{q_1+4}, \quad c_1 = \frac{\theta_0^{7/2}}{\theta_0+\phi_0} \text{ and } c_2 = \frac{\theta_0}{c_1^{\frac{1}{4+q_1}}}.
\end{equation}
Which is is an expression for the total distance to the ablation front as a function of the starting values of the trajectory (and $q_1$). We compare these values corresponding to the $\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}}$ with $T_a$ values on the order of unity in figure \ref{heatplots}. Inspired by the accuracy of the analytic model represented in figure \ref{fig_5} we seek to extend its succes to $\theta \geq T_t/T_a$ where immediately after we cross the ablation front $\theta_0 = T_t/T_a$ and $\phi_0 = \phi_s(\eta(\theta))$ evaluated at $\theta = T_t/T_a$ .

\section{Basko}
In his paper M. M. Basko \cite{Basko2015} describes a more generalised model which instead of equation \ref{eq:12} uses the following formulation 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:30}
\begin{split}
\Theta^n \frac{d\Theta}{d\bar{x}} = \bar{S_r} + (1 - \phi_r)q \Theta^{\beta/\alpha} \\
\Theta^m \frac{d\bar{S_r}}{d\bar{x}} = \lambda_r ( \Gamma_r \Theta^4 - \bar{J_r})\\
\Theta^m \frac{d\bar{J_r}}{d\bar{x}} = -3\lambda_r \bar{S_r}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
taken from eq 54, 61 and 62 respectively. In Table \ref{table:models_comparison} 2 we compare the values of the variables in the models and lay the groundwork for incorporating the numerical values from the Tin case values in Basko's model into our own.

The rightmost column describes how we incorporate the "Basko case" into our own model.}
    \label{table:models_comparison}
\end{table}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:31}
\begin{split}
\frac{d \theta}{d\eta} = (\phi + \frac{19}{20}\theta^{16/9})\theta^{-19/10}\\
\frac{d\phi}{d\eta} =\begin{cases} -\frac{d}{d\eta}\big(\frac{\kappa_{r,a}}{\kappa_{s,a}}(\theta T_{a})^{q_1+3}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} \big) & \theta < T_t/T_a \\
 \beta_a(\theta^4-\theta_r^4)\theta^{-25/9}   &  \theta \geq T_t/T_a. \\
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Writing down the incorporated model in the shape of equation \ref{eq:12} yields equation \ref{eq:31} where we have added the optically thick case $\theta < T_t/T_a $ from our own analysis.

Reinserting the expression for $\frac{d \phi}{ d\eta}$ from equation \ref{eq:12}, going to a single second order differential equation and solving for $\frac{d^2 \theta}{d \eta^2}$ in the same way as was done for equation \ref{eq:15}. We reach the following expression 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:32}
\frac{d^2 \theta}{d \eta^2} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{-152 \kappa_{s,a} \theta^{7/9} \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}+171 \kappa_{s,a} \theta^{9/10} \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}^2+270 \kappa_{r,a} T_a^3 \theta^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}^2 (T_a \theta)^{q_1}+90 \kappa_{r,a} q_1 T_a^3 \theta^2 \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}^2 (T_a \theta)^{q_1}}{90 \left(-\kappa_{s,a} \theta^{19/10}-\kappa_{r,a} T_a^3 \theta^3 (T_a \theta)^{q_1}\right)}\\
-\frac{\beta_t \theta_R^4}{\theta^{421/90}}+\frac{\beta_t}{\theta^{61/90}}+\frac{76 \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}}{45 \theta^{101/90}}-\frac{19 \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}^2}{10 \theta}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
similarly to equation \ref{eq:19} in the large temperature limit the differential equation reduces to

\begin{equation}\label{eq:44}
\begin{split}
\lim_{{T_a \to \infty}} \frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} = \frac{-(3+q_1)}{\theta}(\frac{d\theta}{d\eta})^2 \Longrightarrow \int_{}^{} \frac{1}{v} \, dv = \int_{}^{} \frac{-(3+q_1)}{\theta} \, d\theta \\
\text{where } v = \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}\Longrightarrow \theta_s(\eta) = \big((4+q_1)\eta+c_1\big)^{1/(4+q_1)}c2\\
\text{ and } \phi_s(\eta) = \theta_s^{16/9} \left(\theta_s^{11/90} \frac{d \theta}{d \eta}-\frac{19}{20}\right)\\
\text{where } c_1 = \frac{\theta_0^{29/10}}{\frac{19}{20}\theta_0^{16/9}+\phi_0} \text{ and } c_2 = \theta_0 c_1^{\frac{-1}{4+q_1}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Below we work out the required starting conditions required for a radiative ablation front to form. Where we use $T_a = 27$ev, $P_a = 10^{12} N/m^2$, $v_a = 3000$ m/s. Recall that a negative value here of $S_r$ refers to radiation being absorbed instead of emitted by a unit volume.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \phi_0 > -\frac{19}{20}\theta_0^{16/9} \text{ and } \theta_0 <1 \Longrightarrow S_{r,0} > -\frac{19}{20}\frac{5 P_a v_a}{2 T_a^{16/9}} T_0 ^{16/9} \\ \Longrightarrow S_{r,0} > -2.033 \times 10^{13} T_0^{16/9}(W/m^2)

\section{Cretin}
In the study of laser-produced tin plasmas, testing of the applicability of the theory of double ablation fronts is a necessity. For this purpose we employed a robust and versatile simulation tool. The Cretin software package, developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at the direction of Dr. Howard A. Scott\cite{Scott2001}, stands out as an excellent candidate. This multi--dimensional non--local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiation transfer code provides a comprehensive framework suitable for modelling laboratory plasmas.

At the heart of Cretin's utility is its competence in atomic kinetics and radiation transfer. This capability is the main reason we chose Cretin over for example RALEF, considering our focus on the intricacies of tin plasmas under laser--induced conditions. By handling detailed atomic level populations and transition rates, Cretin provides insights into the opacities, emissivities, heat capacities, and conduction coefficients of the plasma. These aspects are integral to understanding the plasmas behaviour, especially when investigating the stability and efficiency of EUV generation.

A critical aspect of our research is understanding the radiation transport--induced double ablation fronts in densely laser--produced tin plasmas. Here, Cretinâ€™s treatment of atomic kinetics and radiation transfer emerges as particularly relevant. By encompassing most common atomic processes such as excitation and ionization, Cretin allows for a nuanced simulation of the plasma state. Furthermore, its division of radiation transfer into three phases; continuum, lines, and spectral radiation which facilitates a comprehensive analysis. The spectral radiation phase produces detailed plasma spectra without influencing the rest of the simulation, thereby enabling an accurate representation of the plasma conditions.

In summary, the Cretin software package emerges as an indispensable tool in our study of tin plasmas. Its comprehensive approach to simulating atomic kinetics and radiation transfer, combined with its flexible and detailed post-processing capabilities, aligns seamlessly with the objectives of our research. By leveraging Cretin's strengths, we aim to deepen our understanding of the double ablation fronts in tin plasmas, contributing significantly to the field of plasma physics and EUV lithography technology.

On top of Cretin we've build the so--called \href{https://github.com/bowiebrewster/cretin_package}{Cretin front end} to make the operating of Cretin smoother. The capabilities of the front end include easily readable code written in python, drop-down menus explaining the purpose of functions. Looping over any combinations of variable sets included in simulations. The fronted allows searching of the generator files written by Dr Scott. Large parts of the documentation are available in JSON format for help with producing graphical output. The front end automatically creates an environment to run cretin in, writes the generator file that cretin takes as input, runs cretin with that generator file, reads the output that cretin produces and turns that into graphical output including heat plots and animated plots.

\section{Footnote: radiative transfer equation}
The derivation in this section recounts arguments from \cite{MihalasMihalas1984}. The equation of radiative transfer in its most general form  describes a beam of light travelling through a medium subject to the effects of absorption, emission and scattering. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:33}
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{c}}{\frac {d }{d t}}I_{\nu }+{\hat {\Omega }}\cdot \nabla I_{\nu }+(k_{\nu ,s}+k_{\nu ,a})\rho I_{\nu }=j_{\nu }\rho +{\frac {1}{4\pi }}k_{\nu ,s}\rho \int _{\Omega }I_{\nu }d\Omega }
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light, $j_{\nu}$ is the emission coefficient, $k_{\nu, s}$ is the scattering opacity, $k_{\nu, a}$ is the absorption opacity, $\rho$ is the mass density of the material, the subscript $\nu$ indicates a frequency dependency, the subscripts $a$ and $s$ are used to differentiate between scattering and absorption, and the rightmost term represents radiation scattered from other directions onto a surface. We start out by assuming a static medium $\frac{d}{d t}I_{\nu} = 0$, no scattering $k_{v,s} = 0$ and a 1d medium ${\hat {\Omega }}\cdot \nabla \rightarrow \frac{d}{d z}$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:34}
    (\frac{d}{d z} +\rho k_{\nu ,a}) I_{\nu} = \rho j_{\nu} 
\end{equation}
In the literature, the source function $S$ and the optical depth $\tau$ are defined in the following way to allow for a more concise formula.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:35}
    S_{\nu} = \frac{j_{\nu}}{k_{\nu,a}}, \quad d\tau_{\nu} = -\rho {k_{\nu,a}} dz, \quad  \frac{d I_{\nu}}{d \tau_{\nu}} = I_{\nu}-S_{\nu}
\end{equation}

Furthermore if the medium is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), then $S_\nu = B_{\nu}(T)$; the Planckian distribution. If the medium is composed of grey material (one whose absorption coefficient is independent of frequency) all frequency dependency can be integrated out which in the Planckian yields the well know Stefan's law.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:36}
\displaystyle B_{\nu }(\nu ,T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\frac {1}{\exp \left({\frac {h\nu }{k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}\right)-1}}  ,\quad \frac{d I}{d \tau} = I-\sigma T^4
\end{equation}
where $h$ is Plank's constant, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Note that $T = T(\tau)$. The solution to this differential equation is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:37}
    I(\tau) = e^{\tau }\left( c_1 - \sigma \int _1^{\tau }e^{-t}  T(t)^4dt \right).
\end{equation}
If we assume the diffusion limit is reached such that the optical depth is large and photon mean free paths are small $\tau_\nu >>1,\quad S_\nu \rightarrow B_\nu$, the source function can be Taylor expanded in the following way 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:38}
    S_{\nu}(t_\nu) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} B^{n}_{\nu}(\tau_{\nu})(t_{\nu}-\tau_{\nu})^n/n!
\end{equation}
where $B^{n}_{\nu}(\tau_{\nu})$ is the nth derivative of the Planckian distribution. Similarly the flux $H_\nu(\tau_\nu)$ (using Eddington notation) can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:39}
    H_\nu(\tau_\nu) = \frac{d B_\nu}{3 d \tau_\nu} + \frac{d^3 B_\nu}{5 d \tau^3_\nu}+...
\end{equation}
Which by the same diffusion limits assumption allows us to ignore higher order terms. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:40}
    H_\nu(\tau_\nu) = \frac{d B_\nu}{3 d \tau_\nu} = -\frac{1}{3} \frac{d B_\nu}{ d T} \frac{d T}{\rho {k_{\nu,a}} d z} 
\end{equation}
where we used equation \ref{eq:25}. Integrating out the frequency in equation \ref{eq:30} naturally leads us to the Rosseland mean free path $l_r$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:41}
\begin{aligned}
    H(\tau) &=  \int_{0}^{\infty}  H(\tau_{\nu})d\nu = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{d T}{\rho  d z} \int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{d B_\nu}{ d T} \frac{1}{{k_{\nu,a}}} d\nu \\
      &= \frac{1}{3 \rho}\frac{d T}{d z}\frac{\frac{d B}{d T}}{\int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{d B_\nu}{ d T} d\nu}\int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{d B_\nu}{ d T} \frac{1}{{k_{\nu,a}}}  \\
      &=  \frac{1}{3 \rho}\frac{d B}{d z}\frac{1}{l_r}, \text{ where } \frac{1}{l_r} = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k_{\nu, a}} \cdot B_{\nu}(T) \, d\nu}{\int_{0}^{\infty} B_{\nu}(T) \, d\nu},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
furthermore if we define the effective radiative conductivity $K_R$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:42}
   K_R = \frac{1}{3 \rho} \int_{0}^{\infty}   \frac{d B_\nu}{ d T} \frac{1}{{k_{\nu,a}}} d\nu = \frac{1}{3\rho l_r} \frac{d B}{d T} \rightarrow H(\tau) = -K_R \frac{d T}{d z}
\end{equation}
which shows that in an opaque medium the radiant heat flux has the same mathematical form as molecular heat conduction in a gas as described by Fick's law.
